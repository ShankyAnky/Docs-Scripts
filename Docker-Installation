Step 1 — Installing Docker

//First, update your existing list of packages:
sudo apt update

//Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

//Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

//Add the Docker repository to APT sources:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"

//Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:
sudo apt update

//Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:
apt-cache policy docker-ce

//Finally, install Docker:
sudo apt install docker-ce

//Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it's running:
sudo systemctl status docker

Step 2 — Executing the Docker Command Without Sudo (Optional)

sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

//To apply the new group membership, log out of the server and back in, or type the following:

//Confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:
id -nG
